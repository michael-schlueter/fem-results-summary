# Frontend Mentor Results Summary Component
> This is a solution to a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenge. The challenge was to build a results summary component and get it as close to the provided design as possible.



## General Information
- This project is the first project of the "JavaScript frameworks and libraries" career path from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)
- I chose to use React for this project because I was already familiar working with it
- I decided to use Tailwind for styling because I wanted to gain practical experience in implementing a provided design using Tailwind



## Technologies Used
- React 18.3.1
- TypeScript 5.2.2
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.7
- clsx 2.1.1



## Features
- displays a summary of results
- uses a responsive design
- includes hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- uses local JSON data to dynamically populate the content
- adding Tailwind classes conditionally using the clsx utility
